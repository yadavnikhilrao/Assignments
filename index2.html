<p>Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi. <br> The capital of India, Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions.The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). <br> According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million. Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities of Ghaziabad, <br> Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).<br> 
    I live in Delhi. Delhi is the capital of India. It is a beautiful city. It stands on the bank of river Yamuna. Delhi was born during the Mahabharata time, about 1000 BC. Since then it took seven births. During this period, it faced Aryans, Mughals and the Britishers. Delhi is divided into two parts. <br> Old Delhi and New Delhi. New Delhi is very beautiful. It was constructed by Lutyens. The old Delhi was constructed during the Mughal period. Old Delhi is very crowded. <br> In New Delhi, there are beautiful parks and gardens. Nehru Park, Talkatora Garden, Lodhi Garden and Buddha Park are worth seeing gardens. Old Delhi has very majestic buildings of great historical importance too. Delhi is a great center of trade, industries and education. <br> Karol Bagh, Chandni Chowk, Connaught Place and Lajpat Nagar are beautiful and famous shopping markets. Delhi is the heart of India. <br> Delhi is a historical city. The old buildings remind us about its glorious past. The people come to Delhi to see the historical places like Qutab Minar, Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Parliament House, National Museum, Gurudwara Sis Ganj, <br> India Gate and Zoo. I like it very much. Today Delhi has a rapid transport system in the country with its Metro-trains and government has decided to make it a world class city. <br> There are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name Delhi. One of them is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BCE and named it after himself.<br> <br>
